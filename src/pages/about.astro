          <p>
            Hi again, to reintroduce myself. My name is <strong>Reynaldi Wong</strong>. I’ve always been a lazy person. Because of that, I constantly ask myself "What if I could just automate everything?" That mindset led me to study Mechatronics Engineering.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            After graduating, I began working with microcontrollers and robotics, using tools like Arduino, PLCs, and even Raspberry Pi. And then, Somewhere along the way, somehow i began working as a DevOps Engineer. That discovery changed my direction.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            I really enjoy working with Kubernetes, Docker, and Jenkins. How a deployment pipeline for a containerized application can be automated.
